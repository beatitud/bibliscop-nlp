## Get Started

First, download the necessary data [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WkdPLJGzpbapm7Us9EPcIsQm2XSLCgl6) and make sure you have this ```data/``` folder at the root of this repository.


Then, open Jupyter Notebook with:
```shell
$ jupyter notebook
```

Now feel free to run the different cells of the notebook, get inspired, and try new things in new files.
